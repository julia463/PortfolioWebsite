            <p class="intro">Hello! My name is Julia, and I am a 4th year Computer Science student at Cal Poly Pomona. I am hoping to become a frontend
                developer when I graduate. Here is a little bit of information about myself:
                <br>
                <br>
                I began my coding journey my junior year of high school, when I decided to attend my high school's coding camp, where I learned a little bit
                about HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. To be honest, I didn't think I would enjoy coding, but I really enjoyed designing websites, and seeing my hard 
                work show up on the screen. I then decided to try out for my school's coding team, and sure enough, I got in! 
                <br>
                <br>
                Two years later, I ended up going to Cal Poly Pomona to study Computer Science. I've enjoyed my classes so far, but I'm really liking the classes
                I'm taking this semester because I can take classes that heavily relate to my career aspirations, specifically CS 2450 and CS 2250!
            </p>

            <p>Over the past couple of years, I've had the opportunity to hone my skills professionally!
